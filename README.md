# Amy Brown's SQL Portfolio

Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects and while working through SQL, machine learning, and other data analytics courses. Below are a few highlighted projects. Feel free to take a look around and [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amymartikabrown/) if you have any questions.

## Highlighted Projects
* **Spotify Top Songs Analaysis** - [SQL](https://github.com/amymartika/SQL/blob/main/Spotify%20Top%20Songs%202021%20Data%20Analysis): In this project, I used a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze trends in the top 50 songs of 2021. Using pitch-class integer notation, I examined the key and tonality for these top songs. I joined data from a Hooktheory database to compare the most popular song keys with the song keys most represented in the top 50 Spotify tracks of 2021.
* **World Happiness Rankings Dashboard** - [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amymartika/viz/WorldHappinessReport_16737679931360/WorldHappinessReport): In this dashboard, I used a dataset found on Kaggle that ranked the happiness of 155 countries from 2015 to 2019. I quantified the top factors impacting happiness and visualized these by country. The user can select a country to view its detailed stats while comparing that data to the world average.
* **Predictive Book Ratings Analysis** - [SQL](https://github.com/amymartika/SQL/blob/main/Predicting%20Book%20Ratings): In this project, I used my own data from Goodreads to analyze how my book ratings differ from the average ratings found on Goodreads. I categorized the books by genre and obtained the average difference in rating per genre. I created another table containing similar data for books that won the Booker Prize for Fiction from 2000-2021 and joined this data to predict, for each Booker Prize-winning book, what my rating would be.
* **Sales and Profitability Dashboard** - [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amymartika/viz/ExecutiveOverview_16733205488000/ExecutiveOverview): In this dashboard, I used a dataset containing sales data from 2018 to 2021. I featured data such as sales KPIs, sales by state, profit ratio per state, and sales by category and region. My dashboard allows the user multilpe interactive points, including hovering over a state to view profit ratio by city, selecting a region to focus on their metrics, and using a sliding scale to filter states by profit ratio.
